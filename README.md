# Ferrum/Liber: A Description

This Application allows users to register an account with an API and there can store workouts they have completed. Also gives them the ability to update past workouts and delete them if they no longer want them in there log.

## Planning Story
My plan was to set up communication to API first and get all my forms working so users can register and create workouts. Once all that was done I focused on styling and making sure the application had a nice flow.


### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new workout
- As a user I want to View all my workouts
- As a user I want to Update past workouts
- As a user I want to Delete a workout

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Handlebars

### Unsolved Problems

- I would at some point like to have pre made workouts stored for a user to be able to choose.
- Would like to eventually add an area for user to add notes about a workout.
- Would like to do more styling.
